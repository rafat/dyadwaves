= DyadWaves =

  DyadWaves is an easy to use GUI for 1D and 2D Wavelet Transform. This software is pretty basic with functionality consisting of computing Wavelet Transform , signal/image approximation and denoising using up to three transform modes. 

== Overview ==

=== Transform Modes ===

 There are three available modes

#1 *dwt_sym* - Decimated Discrete Wavelet Transform using symmetric extension.

#2 *dwt_per* - Decimated Discrete Wavelet Transform using periodic extension.

#3 *swt* - Stationary (Undecimated) Wavelet Transform. It also uses peiodi extension.
