= DyadWaves =

  DyadWaves is an easy to use GUI for 1D and 2D Wavelet Transform. This software is pretty basic with functionality consisting of computing Wavelet Transform , signal/image approximation and denoising using up to three transform modes.

== Overview ==

=== Transform Modes ===

 There are three available modes

#1 *dwt_sym* - Decimated Discrete Wavelet Transform using symmetric extension.

#2 *dwt_per* - Decimated Discrete Wavelet Transform using periodic extension.

#3 *swt* - Stationary (Undecimated) Wavelet Transform. It also uses peiodic extension.

=== Wavelet Families ===

  Four wavelet families are available.

1. *Daubechies*- 15 orthogonal wavelets are available, ranging from 2-tap filters to 30-tap filters.

2. *Biorthogonal* - Symmetric filter wavelets. bior1.1 to bior6.8

3. *Coiflets* - 5 wavelets. coif1 - coif5.

4. *Symmlets* - 10 wavelets from sym1 to sym10.

  Wavelets, associated filters and filter frequency response can be plotted by selecting the wavelet from the "Choose Wavelet Family" dropdown box in the DWT Dashboard and then using appropriate pushbuttons in the Display Dashboard as shown below.

=== Input/Output ===

*1D ::* 1D I/O  is very, very basic at this point. It accepts text files arranged in either one row or one column. You can save outputs (coefficients and processed signal) in the same 1D text format or you can save graphs as image/pdf/svg files.

*2D ::* Input is in the form of images ( tif,tiff,jpeg,bmp,png). Output images can be saved in these same five formats. I expect to add more formats in upcoming versions.
