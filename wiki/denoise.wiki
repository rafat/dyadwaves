== DeNoising ==

  If DyadWaves' denoising interface seems a bit intimidating, it is probably because it offers more choices than are necessary. Most available wavelets, decomposition level etc. won't give you acceptable results most of the time. A few wavelets (symmlets - sym4 and sym8, Daubechies orthogonal wavelets) are the ones you should probably work with. This software is aimed mostly at students and beginners in this field so it makes sense to have as many options as possible. I have used 2 methods ([http://www-stat.stanford.edu/~donoho/reports.html#1993 visushrink] and [http://www-stat.stanford.edu/~donoho/reports.html#1993 sureshrink]) for 1D and three methods([http://www-stat.stanford.edu/~donoho/reports.html#1993 visushrink], [http://www-stat.stanford.edu/~donoho/reports.html#1993 sureshrink] and [http://infoscience.epfl.ch/record/33854 bayesshrink]) for 2D .
