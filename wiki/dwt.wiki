== Wavelet Transform ==

   There are three wavelet transform modes - dwt_sym, swt and dwt_per. Each has same display system and the DWT output can be saved as a text file using the "Save DWT Output" button. 

=== 1D::Decimated DWT (Symmetric Extension) ===

 Of all the modes , this one is the best equipped to deal with signal boundary issues. Signal is symmetrically extended at every stage so there are no sharp jumps and discontinuities. On the negative side, there is some redundancy in the system as this isn't an N input N output system.
