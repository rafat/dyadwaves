This Wavelet GUI for windows system is practically in alpha testing stage
and it has some stability issues. There is also the matter of its speed not
being upto the par and this will require some code rewrite from the scratch.
In the meantime you may want to work in the grayscale mode for images 
larger than 512 X 512. I've added "View DWT Report" button which will return
the DWT computation time. If you come across any errors or you have any 
suggestions, complaints and/or advice I can be reached at
